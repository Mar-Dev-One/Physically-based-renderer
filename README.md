# PBR-Renderer

A physically based renderer and game engine in C11 and OpenGL 4.6, built as a static library,
with a testbed.

- **Rendering**: Cook-Torrance GGX metallic-roughness shading, image-based lighting from HDRIs
  (multi-scatter, specular occlusion), cascaded shadow maps with filtered soft shadows, HDR
  rendering with ACES tone mapping and exposure, directional / point / spot lights.
- **Scene**: an entity-component world with generational handles, reflected components, a
  reference-counted asset cache, and JSON scene files.
- **Commands**: every scene change goes through one JSON command API, with validation, clear
  errors, and undo/redo grouped into transactions.
- **Remote control**: a localhost WebSocket server speaking JSON-RPC 2.0, with change
  notifications.

The project is a work in progress; see [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for what's done and
what's next.

## Building

Requirements: CMake 3.10+, a C11 and C++17 compiler (C++ is only for Dear ImGui), and a GPU with
OpenGL 4.6.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Mar-Dev-One/PBR-Renderer.git
cd PBR-Renderer
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

If you cloned without `--recursive`, run `git submodule update --init` first (GLFW, cglm and
cimgui are submodules; the other dependencies are vendored in `engine/deps/`).

This builds the engine as one static library, `PBR_Engine`, and the **Testbed**
(`build/testbed/Release/Testbed.exe` with Visual Studio) on it. The testbed builds a scene in code
with the World API -- a ground plane, a grid of spheres from smooth to rough (dielectric and
metal), a polished Suzanne turning on a pedestal, a sun, a point light and a spot light under an
HDRI sky -- and draws it. Left-drag orbits, the wheel zooms, Esc quits. `--check PNG` renders it
once in a hidden window and saves the picture; `--view NAME` shows a debug view (albedo, normals,
roughness, metallic, ao, shadow, lighting, wireframe, lights). It finds the engine's shaders and
the sample project at runtime, so it can be started from any directory, and its
[main.c](testbed/main.c) is the shortest example of a program using the engine.

## Using the engine

A program fills in an `App` ([engine/src/App.h](engine/src/App.h)) with `on_init`, `on_frame`,
`on_resize` and `on_shutdown` hooks and calls `run()`. In them it builds a `world`
([World/World.h](engine/src/World/World.h)) -- `world_create()`, then components such as
`world_add_mesh_renderer()` (a model from the asset cache, or `assets_builtin()` shapes) and
`world_add_light()` -- or loads one from a scene file (`deserialize_scene()`), and each frame calls
`world_update()` and `scene_renderer_draw()` ([Renderer/SceneRenderer.h](engine/src/Renderer/SceneRenderer.h)).
[testbed/main.c](testbed/main.c) does exactly that.

**Projects.** A project is a folder with a `project.json` (name, startup scene, window size,
input bindings) and `scenes/`, `models/`, `hdri/` and `textures/`; every path in a scene is
relative to it. [assets/](assets/) is the sample project, and [assets/scenes/](assets/scenes/)
holds two example scenes.

**Commands.** Every scene change can also go through one JSON command API
([Commands/Commands.h](engine/src/Commands/Commands.h)), with validation, clear errors and
undo/redo grouped into transactions:

```json
{"cmd": "place_model", "args": {"model": "builtin:sphere", "size": 0.3, "on_ground": true}}
```

Commands cover entities and components (`entity.create`, `component.set`, ...), high-level
placement (`place_model`, `entity.place` relative to other entities), scene files (`scene.save`,
`scene.load`, `scene.list`), undo/redo (`history.*`) and batches; `scene.describe` shows the
current world. A program can add commands of its own (`command_context.host_commands`).

**Remote control.** `server_start()` ([Net/CommandServer.h](engine/src/Net/CommandServer.h)) opens
a command server on `127.0.0.1` and writes how to reach it (port and token) to
`~/.pbr-renderer/server.json`. Any WebSocket client can connect to
`ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/?token=<token>` and send the same commands as JSON-RPC 2.0; every change is
pushed back to connected clients as a `scene.changed` notification. See
[tests/server_test.py](tests/server_test.py) for a stdlib-only Python client.

## Models

`model_load(path)` ([engine/src/Scene/Model.h](engine/src/Scene/Model.h)) picks a loader by file
extension:

| Format | Loader | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `.gltf` / `.glb` | [cgltf](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf) | Scene hierarchy, multiple meshes and materials, embedded or external textures, PBR metallic-roughness (base color, metal/rough, normal, occlusion, emissive), alpha mask/blend, double-sided. |
| `.obj` (+ `.mtl`) | [fast_obj](https://github.com/thisistherk/fast_obj) | Vertices are welded; `Kd`/`Ke`/`Ns`/`d` and `map_Kd`/`map_Ke` become a PBR material. |

Both are converted to the same `model` / `material` / `mesh` types and drawn with
`engine/shaders/pbr.*`. Not supported yet: skinning and animation, morph targets, Draco/meshopt
compression, `KHR_texture_transform`, and second UV sets.

To use a model, put it in the project's `models/` and load it with `assets_load_model()` (or name
it in a scene file). HDRIs work the same way: an equirectangular `.hdr` in the project's `hdri/`. [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/hdris)
is a good source.

## Tests

```sh
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

The C tests are headless (no window or GL context), so they run anywhere. They cover the world,
serialization, commands, undo history, placement, JSON-RPC and encoding. With Python 3 on the
path, ctest also runs an end-to-end test of the WebSocket server.
